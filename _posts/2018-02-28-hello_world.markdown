#### Why did you decide to learn software development?

`cout << "Hello, World"`

I still remember the rush from running that first line of code and seeing it actually work.  Then, I remember the fun of solving problems and making things.


#### Building
Programming is powerful.  One line of code can make something happen.  With enough logic and text, you can build just about anything.  


#### Breaking
Iteration is fast. Is there an error? Do the tests pass? Is the behavior what was expected?

Quick feedback means quicker response. You get more time to spend on creating fixes and improvements instead of waiting to see if it worked. 

Test often and break things, so you can solve as you go.


#### The Past and Future
My background is in computer animation.  It's creative and technical.  Animation is a multidisciplinary form including illustration, graphic design, storytelling, acting, movement, cinematography, editing, effects, sound and more.  Different software for all of those are wrangled together to produce the final piece. 

It isn't boring. There is no way to master every aspect. Technology and trends constantly evolve, so there is always something to learn and plenty of room for growth.

Software development is very similar with even faster changes. It's very flexible and has high utility.  I'm excited to make more types of things with interactivity, memory, behavior and functionality. 

#### Bonus

One of my first computer animations was actually built from C++ code with `circle()`.  It's recreated here in a pixel art style using After Effects.
