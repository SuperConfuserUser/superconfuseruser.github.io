<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World"</code></p>

<p>I still remember the rush from running that first line of code and seeing it actually work.  Then, I remember the fun of solving problems and making things.</p>

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>Programming is powerful.  One line of code can make something happen.  With enough logic and text, you can build just about anything.</p>

<h2 id="breaking">Breaking</h2>
<p>Iteration is fast. Is there an error? Do the tests pass? Is the behavior what was expected?</p>

<p>Quick feedback means quicker response. You get more time to spend on creating fixes and improvements instead of waiting to see if it worked.</p>

<p>Test often and break things, so you can solve as you go.</p>

<h2 id="the-past-and-future">The Past and Future</h2>
<p>My background is in computer animation.  It’s creative and technical.  Animation is a multidisciplinary form including illustration, graphic design, storytelling, acting, movement, cinematography, editing, effects, sound and more.  Different software for all of those are wrangled together to produce the final piece.</p>

<p>It isn’t boring. There is no way to master every aspect. Technology and trends constantly evolve, so there is always something to learn and plenty of room for growth.</p>

<p>Software development is very similar with even faster changes. It’s very flexible and has high utility.  I’m excited to make more types of things with interactivity, memory, behavior and functionality.</p>

<p>One of my first computer animations was actually built from C++ code with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code>.  It’s recreated here in a pixel art style using After Effects.</p>
